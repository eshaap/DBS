#1. A job portal company wants to help users understand skill relationships in the IT domain.
#Using pre-trained GloVe embeddings, build a program that:
#1. Takes a technical skill from the user
#2. Displays the top 5 similar skills with similarity score
#3. Find the odd one out from the list: Python, Java, C++, HTML, Ruby ###

!pip install gensim

from gensim.downloader import load

# Load pre-trained GloVe model
model = load("glove-wiki-gigaword-50")
print("Model loaded successfully!")

# -------- Similar skills --------
skill = input("\nEnter a technical skill: ").lower()

print("\nTop 5 similar skills:")
try:
    for word, score in model.most_similar(skill, topn=5):
        print(f"{word} --> similarity: {score:.4f}")
except KeyError:
    print("Skill not found in vocabulary.")

# -------- Odd one out --------
skills = ["python", "java", "c++", "html", "ruby"]

print("\nGiven skills:", skills)
print("Odd one out:", model.doesnt_match(skills))
