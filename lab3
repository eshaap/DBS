#3. A customer support chatbot must understand misspelled product names. Train a FastText word embedding model on sample product reviews and:
#i. Find similar words for a misspelled word
#ii. Show how FastText handles unseen words better than Word2Vec

!pip install gensim 

from gensim.models import FastText, Word2Vec

# Sample product reviews
data = [
    "this phone camera is good",
    "battery of phone is great",
    "mobile phone has nice display"
]

sentences = [d.split() for d in data]

# Train models
ft = FastText(sentences, vector_size=50, min_count=1, epochs=30)
w2v = Word2Vec(sentences, vector_size=50, min_count=1, epochs=30)

misspelled = "fone"

print("FastText similar words:")
print(ft.wv.most_similar(misspelled, topn=3))

print("\nWord2Vec similar words:")
try:
    print(w2v.wv.most_similar(misspelled, topn=3))
except KeyError:
    print("Word2Vec cannot handle misspelled/unseen word")
