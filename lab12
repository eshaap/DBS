#12.A college wants to automatically classify student feedback as Positive or Negative using an LLM.

from transformers import pipeline

# Load sentiment analysis model (LLM-based)
classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

# Function to classify feedback
def classify_feedback(feedback):
    result = classifier(feedback)[0]
    label = result["label"]

    if label == "POSITIVE":
        return "Positive"
    else:
        return "Negative"

# Example feedbacks
feedbacks = [
    "The teacher explains concepts very clearly.",
    "The classes are boring and difficult to understand."
]

# Classify feedbacks
for fb in feedbacks:
    print(f"Feedback: {fb}")
    print(f"Sentiment: {classify_feedback(fb)}\n")
